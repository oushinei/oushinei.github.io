# 🌟 About Me
I am a doctoral student enrolled in the Graduate School of Commerce at [Chuo University](https://www.chuo-u.ac.jp/). My supervisor is Professor [Jaewoo Park](https://c-research.chuo-u.ac.jp/html/100003068_ja.html). My research focuses on providing behavioral solutions to major failures within the global food system, specifically at the consumer-policy interface. Leveraging theories from Consumer/Social Psychology and Behavioral Economics, I employ rigorous experimental designs and quantitative methods to uncover the micro-level psychological mechanisms that drive food choices. My goal is to develop effective behavioral interventions and policy nudges to promote sustainable and healthy consumption behaviors. 

**Key Research Foci:**
- **Mitigating the Sustainable Protein Adoption Failure:** Examining consumer acceptance barriers towards sustainable protein sources (e.g., insect-based foods and cultured meat) to facilitate food system transformation.
- **Tackling the Health Failure:** Exploring behavioral drivers of healthy food choices to combat the rising burden of obesity.
- **Addressing the Efficiency Failure:** Investigating consumer rejection of imperfect/ugly foods to develop behavioral strategies for food waste reduction.
